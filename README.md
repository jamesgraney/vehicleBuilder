# Vehicle Builder Demo


## Description
This application was built as an experiment in using classes and organizing code into separate files, with vehicles serving as a clear example of object-oriented programming (OOP). A car, motorcycle, and truck are all types of vehicles, each with unique functionalities. By interacting with the application, you’ll see how OOP concepts come to life.

This project is primarily a learning tool rather than a solution to a specific problem. However, it effectively demonstrates how to separate an interface from its underlying objects.

## Installation

To get started, download or clone the repository and run: npm start

This will launch the application, allowing you to create and customize cars, trucks, and motorcycles. (Because who wouldn’t want their own mini vehicle builder?)

## Usage

A video demonstration of the application can be found [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7JnkbPCzaw].

Once installed, you can start building vehicles from scratch or experiment with the provided presets. Can all vehicles perform wheelies? Can any vehicle tow another? What happens if a vehicle is too heavy to be towed? These are just some of the questions you can explore while learning about OOP in action.
